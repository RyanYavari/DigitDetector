# Running the Application

This application consists of three main parts: the backend server, the Flask application, and the frontend React application.

## Backend Server

To run the backend server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `Backend.js` file.
4. Run the backend server with the following commands:
```bash
npm install
```
then
```bash
node backend.js
```

After running this command, the backend server should be up and running.

## Flask Application

1. Open a new terminal window (do not close the terminal running the backend server).
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `flask_app.py` file.
3. Run the following commands to start the Flask application:
```bash
pip install tensorflow
```
then
```bash
python flask_app.py
```

After running this command, the Flask application should be up and running.

## Frontend Application

1. Open a new terminal window (do not close the terminals running the backend server and Flask application).
2. Navigate to the `src` directory.
3. Run the following command to start the frontend application:
```bash
npm install
```
then
```bash
npm install react-signature-canvas
```
then
```
npm install react-apexcharts apexcharts
```
then
```bash
npm start
```

After running this command, the frontend application should be up and running. You can view the application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000 (or the URL provided in your terminal).

Please ensure you have Node.js, Flask, and npm installed on your machine before running these commands. If not, you can download and install them from their official websites.
